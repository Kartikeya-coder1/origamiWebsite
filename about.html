        <h1><u>ORIGAMI PASSIONATES</u></h1>
        <h2>This web page is made specially for origami lovers!<br>
            We believe that Origami is a very creative art.It enhances not only our imagination,
            but also our creativity.Origami excites other modalities of learning. It has been shown to improve spatial visualization skills using hands-on learning. Such skills allow children to comprehend, characterize, and construct their own vernacular for the world around them.
            Folding paper can demonstrate the fractions in a tactile way.Origami is a fun way to explain physics concepts.
            <br> Thus we are passionate in teaching everyone about origami.
